  Quiz App Overview

  This is a fully-featured multiplayer quiz application (similar to Kahoot) built for BCBA/RBT team training sessions. It's production-ready and well-organized.

  Tech Stack:
  - React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
  - TailwindCSS for styling
  - Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)
  - Zustand for state management
  - Deployed on Vercel

  Core Features:
  ✅ Quiz creation & editing (multiple choice, true/false)
  ✅ Real-time multiplayer gameplay with QR code join
  ✅ Comprehensive scoring (base points + speed bonuses + streaks)
  ✅ Warmup/trivia questions (don't affect scores)
  ✅ Avatar customization system
  ✅ Leaderboards & game history
  ✅ Dual mode support (authenticated or guest)
  ✅ Host & player interfaces with live updates

  Project State:
  - No TODOs found in the codebase
  - Clean, well-organized structure
  - Properly configured for deployment
  - All core features appear complete

For normal changes you don’t need to repeat all that setup. Use this loop:

Code changes: work locally, test (npm run dev), run npm run build if you want to precheck.
Supabase: only when you add/modify migrations. After a migration, run supabase db push once.
GitHub: commit and push (env vars/remote are already set):
git add .
git commit -m "Describe change"
git push
Vercel: push to main will auto-deploy with existing env vars. If you ever want to force a deploy from local:
npx vercel --prod
So the only extra command beyond git push is supabase db push when schema changes; otherwise push and Vercel builds.

  Some things I would like to change.

  I want the accessories on the avatar like kahoots does, like glasses or hat should display on the avatar (fox wearing a hat, panda wearing glasses etc...), how complicated would that be?
