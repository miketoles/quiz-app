@doodlestein on X says, this is a good prompt for ui/ux
"I still think there are strong opportunities to enhance the UI/UX look and feel and to make everything work better and be more intuitive, user-friendly, visually appealing, polished, slick, and world class in terms of following UI/UX best practices like those used by Stripe, don't you agree? And I want you to carefully consider desktop UI/UX and mobile UI/UX separately while doing this and hyper-optimize for both separately to play to the specifics of each modality. I'm looking for true world-class visual appeal, polish, slickness, etc. that makes people gasp at how stunning and perfect it is in every way.  Use ultrathink."

from Codex
For normal changes you don’t need to repeat all that setup. Use this loop:

Code changes: work locally, test (npm run dev), run npm run build if you want to precheck.
Supabase: only when you add/modify migrations. After a migration, run supabase db push once.
GitHub: commit and push (env vars/remote are already set):
git add .
git commit -m "Describe change"
git push
Vercel: push to main will auto-deploy with existing env vars. If you ever want to force a deploy from local:
npx vercel --prod
So the only extra command beyond git push is supabase db push when schema changes; otherwise push and Vercel builds.
